# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-Game

This is a Java implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The program utilizes various Java libraries and functions to run the game, handle user input, place game pieces on the board, check for a winner, and handle errors. The program uses an array to represent the game board and two lists to store the positions of the player and CPU's pieces. Additionally, it employs the Scanner class to read input from the user, and the Random class to generate the CPU's positions. The program includes exception handling to ensure the player enters valid input and to catch any errors that may occur during gameplay. It also uses a Minimax algorithm to select the best move for the CPU, making the game more challenging for the player.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
Java SE Development Kit 8 or higher

Git


### Installing
#### To compile and run the Tic-Tac-Toe AI game code, you must have Java installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file.

2. Copy the code into the file and save it with the name "TicTacToe.java".

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

4. Compile the code by typing "javac TicTacToe.java" and press enter.

5. Run the code by typing "java TicTacToe" and press enter.

6. This will launch the game and you can start playing against the AI. The game will display the board, and you can make a move by entering the row and column numbers of the position you want to place your mark. The AI will then make its move, and the game will continue until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw. Enjoy playing the Tic-Tac-Toe AI game!



### How to Play
#### 1. The game is played on a 3x3 board.

#### 2. Players take turns placing their pieces (X for the player, O for the CPU) on the board by entering a number between 1 and 9. The numbers correspond to the positions on the board as follows:

1 | 2 | 3

4 | 5 | 6

7 | 8 | 9

#### 3. The first player to get three of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

#### 4. If the board is filled with no winner, the game is a draw.

#### 5. Players can play again by entering "yes" at the end of the game.
